NOTE: system breaks when time of work (TOW) per slot exceeds the SECONDS_PER_TICK.

Emptying the callback queue MUST finish before the current tick is over -> HARD REQUIREMENT

TTW/slot is determined almost completely by the update_time(secret) X num(calls)/slot.

Seconds per tick must accomodate TOW/slot, otherwise rescheduling of calls could occur
during the same tick. 

I should experiment with the SECONDS_PER_TICK and NUM_WORKER to increase system capacity.
